### 1. (4 points) based on ROS 7.3
Simulate 100 data points from the model, y = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + error, with the values of x being sampled at random from a uniform distribution on [0,50], errors that are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 3, and b_0, b_1, b_2 chosen so that the data shows a clear nonlinear curve.

  a. Fit a regression line to these data and display the output.
  
  b. Graph a scatterplot of the data and the regression line. This is the best-fit linear regression line, what does "best-fit" mean in this context?

### 2. (4 points) based on ROS 9.2
Using your dataset for project 2, fit a linear regression model. Use the output from this model to simulate a predictive distribution for observations with a particular combination of levels of all predictors in the regression models. Create a figure to summarize the results.
